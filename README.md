A Brief Introduction to Bayesian Statistics
===========================================

Prepared for the [Very Applied Methods](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5881) series at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

The material is largely based on the excellent course by Richard Morey [@richarddmorey](https://github.com/richarddmorey) at Essex Summer School in 2011.

Contents (TBC)
--------------

- Intro to the mathematical background (short, the Bayesian "mantra")
- Specifying priors
- Sampling (Metropolis-Hastings / Gibbs sampling) (also short, but it's good to have an idea what's going on under the hood).
- Convergence (extremely important but often overlooked)
- ~~Variational Inference and other approximations (used e.g. for topic models)~~

Code
----

- Estimating "standard" models in MCMCpack
- Output checks with coda
- ~~Writing your own models in stan~~
